# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise's play *Fever* came close to achieving the goal in a short period of time after launching the fundraising campaign. Now she requested an analysis on previous fundraising campaigns outcomes in relation to launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose

Through this analysis Louise will understand how launching date and goal affects the success of a Theater fundraising campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The graph [Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date] (kickstarter-analysis/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png at main · carolineshipley/kickstarter-analysis (github.com)) shows that in general Theater campaigns have higher success than failure and cancelation, especially during the period between May-July. 

The highest success observed was in May with 111 success campaigns compared to 52 failures and 3 cancelations. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The graph [Outcomes Based on Goal] (kickstarter-analysis/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png at main · carolineshipley/kickstarter-analysis (github.com)) shows that the percentage of successful campaigns for Subcategory Plays starts at 76% successful for goals less than $1000 and decreases reaching 20% successful on the range $25000 to $29999. At the range $15000 to $19999 the percentage of successful is equal the percentage of failed campaigns. 

Between $35000 to $44999 successful percentage becomes higher that percentage failed again, but after that it declines drastically reaching close to 0% on goals higher than $45000. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

A possible challenge of this project could be learning new formulas such as `COUNTIFS`, however the material and videos provided for support were very helpful.

## Results

During the data analysis for *Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date* was observed that campaigns launched in May, June and July have higher success when compared to other months of the year, while December had the lowest success.

During the data analysis of *Outcomes Based on Goal* for Plays Subcategory was observed that campaigns with fundraising goals below $1000 had higher success percentage, while campaigns with goals above $45000 presented the higher failure percentage.

The limitation of this data set is that out of 4114 projects, only 1393 represent Theater and 1066 represent Plays. The time range of launch dates for the projects listed on this data set is between 2009 and 2017 and on the past years fundraising online campaigns became more popular and can reach more people across the world which could change the results of this analysis. 

Additional graphs recommended for this analysis would be outcome of fundraising campaigns by year and outcome of fundraising campaign by country.
